<p>================================</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've also written <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Human-Enhancement-Device-Basic-tDCS-Suppl/">(much
simpler) instructions for a tDCS-only device that you can build
yourself, with just common through-hole parts</a>, made a <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Dual-Channel-Transcranial-Current-Stimulator/">more
advanced two-channel tACS device</a>, and I've set up a <a href="http://www.neuroplustech.com/TMS_preorder.htm">preorder
page</a> for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rtms/comments/7ogwsg/opensource_rtms_device_status_update/">repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation machines</a>! ^.^</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>This device is an open-source replacement* for <a href="http://www.neuroelectrics.com/products/starstim/starstim-tcs/">STARSTIM
tCS</a>, which is sold only to research institutions. I have not been
able to get a price quote for this commercial tCS hardware because I
am not an institution, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/34gc80/star_stim_research_kit_neuroelectricscom/">random
people on reddit say it costs $10,000 to $25,000</a> for the full
Neurostar tCS hardware. Point is, <em>this</em> transcranial
electrical stimulator hardware design is open source, freely
available to all of you and costs about $100 in parts ($95.09 as of
early 2017).</p>
<p>If all you want to do is build, test, and use this device with the
GUI I've written, you don't need to read the step "Here Be
Dragons" or any of the steps after it.</p>
<p>This device can be used for any kind of human electrical
stimulation, such as <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945213001858">tDCS</a>,
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3695369/">tACS</a>,
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/25/11/4334/2367088/High-Frequency-Transcranial-Random-Noise">tRNS</a>,
or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4322601/">tVNS</a>.
Its hardware, when properly constructed and tested, limits output
current such that -2.1mA < output_current < +2.1mA , based on
the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2754807/">2mA
safety limit recommended in these published guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>*This device is only single channel, but this device can be
stacked in parallel with itself without any additional circuitry to
create a multichannel device with any number of channels desired at
about $100 each. The driver code on the computer side will become
hairier as you add channels, though. This device has four times the
maximum output frequency of the STARSTIM tCS device, and comparable
accuracy and DAC step resolution.</p>

stimulation to treat depression</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is the last tES (transcranial electrical
stimulation) device design I post for a while, because I don't see
myself running into the hardware limitations of this one for a long
time. With an Arduino as the SPI signal source, and the firmware
<a href="https://github.com/quicksilv3rflash/Precision_tES_tACS_tRNS_tDCS">posted
here on github</a>, and also <a href="Precision_tES_tACS_tRNS_tDCS-master.zip">hosted locally with this html file</a>it's limited to about 1kHz max output frequency,
but with a higher-speed SPI signal source the device can go up to
30kHz full-swing, so this board should be good enough to replicate
the stimulation pattern in almost all tACS/tDCS/tRNS studies
published to date. I'd say "all" but I'm sure there were
some jokers putting >30kHz into human heads for some reason. If
>30kHz is required, it's relatively simple to swap a
higher-frequency op-amp for the TLC2252. We humans top out at around
150Hz, as far as I know, so 30kHz should be plenty of bandwidth for
injecting signals into us.</p>
<p>This device is designed with safety in mind. The data input (USB,
which may be earth grounded/line powered) is electrically isolated
from the power supply and output to the human (which is
floating/battery powered) in order to prevent ground loops. Also, the
hardware limits the output current to safe levels, +/-2.1mA, based on
the safety limits defined in work at the University of Gottingen, the
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2754807/">"Gottingen
protocols", which among other things specify output current
limited to "currents of 1 – 2 mA applied for durations up to
20 minutes"</a>. In the event of primary regulator failure,
current is limited to +/-4.0mA by the backup safety resistors (in
series with the typical ~4.7kOhm resistance of a human head with
electrodes).</p>
<p>Interface: 3-wire SPI (16 bits per DAC write, no MISO pin, SPI
mode 1, CPOL=0, CPHA=1, MSB first) 
</p>
<p>Precision: Max offset error +/- 15uA (much of this is a result of
fixed offsets, e.g. resistor tolerances, that can be calibrated out
if desired, but some is temperature dependent. This value was
calculated by analyzing the circuit with worst-case offsets published
in component datasheets, error values which lump both manufacturing
offset and temperature-dependent effects)</p>
<p>Precision: DAC step size 1.1uA</p>
<p>Maximum output current: +2.1mA by design, prototype measures +2.08
mA</p>
<p>Minimum output current: -2.1mA by design, prototype measures
-2.09mA</p>
<p>Maximum output frequency of tES circuit board itself: 30kHz
(limited by full-swing amplification bandwidth of TLC2252)</p>
<p>Maximum output frequency of prototype: 976.5625 Hz, 512us per
sample (using USB > Arduino nano as SPI data source, with
1.953125kHz output sample rate)</p>
<p>Maximum SPI clock input frequency of tES circuit board itself:
50MHz</p>
<p>Isolation voltage rating: 5kV</p>

<p>These are all from the same supplier, and I've linked directly to
their product pages. You just need to open the links one by one and
order the listed quantity. Get extras of the cheap ones if you
suspect a tweezer mishap may send a tiny piece irrevocably flying off
into shag carpeting... or you'll have to wait another week and pay
double shipping. If you're feeling skilled, careful, and/or lucky,
order exactly the required number of each piece.</p>

<p>The .zip file provided is compiled for SeeedStudio Fusion PCB
specifically! You'll need to go to the github repository [<a href="https://github.com/quicksilv3rflash/Precision_tES_tACS_tRNS_tDCS/">LINK
TO ASSOCIATED GITHUB REPOSITORY</a>] to get the actual .brd files and
reprocess them if you need gerbers (PCB design files) for a different
manufacturing service. I'm only giving instructions for purchasing
though Seeed here because they're the service I used for the tested
prototypes, and also the cheapest I've found that doesn't noticeably
cut quality. 
</p>
<p>Ordering instructions:</p>
<p>You'll be ordering from <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html">SeeedStudio
Fusion PCB</a>. These people have a two-week maximum manufacturing
turnaround time but a really slow shipping carrier (if you select the
cheapest shipping option, estimate 3-5 weeks to get your boards) and
you have to make an account to order from them, which is annoying.</p>
<p>(CHEAP / FAST / HIGH-QUALITY < one can choose any combination
of two of these three. Seeed is CHEAP and HIGH-QUALITY.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html">GO TO ORDER
PAGE</a></p>
<p>After making an account with SeeedStudio (sorry), you need to
submit a set of gerber files to be manufactured, packaged in a .zip.
I've already assembled the .zip for you, it's embedded at the bottom
this step, seeed_fusionpcb_gerber.zip. Download it. <a href="https://github.com/quicksilv3rflash/Precision_tES_tACS_tRNS_tDCS/blob/master/schematic_and_board_files/seeed_fusionpcb_gerber.zip">This
.zip file is also on github</a>.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html">order
page</a> linked, click the button labeled "Add your gerber
file", browse to your downloaded copy of
seeed_fusionpcb_gerber.zip, and upload it.</p>
<p>Select the following options:</p>
<p>MATERIAL: FR4-TG130 (or whatever says FR4 as the first three
characters)</p>
<p>LAYERS: 2 LAYERS</p>
<p>DIMENSIONS: (manually enter or click the blue autofill
measurements to the right of "DIMENSIONS") 56.5 * 56.5 (mm)</p>
<p>PCB QTY: 10 (might as well, there's no price break for 5...)</p>
<p>PANELIZED PCBS: 1</p>
<p>PCB THICKNESS: 1.6 (mm)</p>
<p>PCB COLOR: GREEN (you can choose a different one but they charge
more)</p>
<p>SURFACE FINISH: HASL</p>
<p>COPPER WEIGHT: 1 OZ.</p>
<p>MIN HOLE SIZE: 0.3mm</p>
<p>MIN TRACKING/SPACING: 6/6 mil</p>
<p>BLIND VIAS: NO</p>
<p>HALF-CUT/CASTELLATED HOLES: NO</p>
<p>IMPEDANCE CONTROL: NO</p>
<p>...then click "add to cart", and then the little cart
icon in the top-right, and then it's a standard online retailer
checkout.</p>
<p>It's highly recommended to get expedited shipping.</p>
<p>(Isn't ordering boards fun? Look at all the miscellaneous units up
there! Ounces (per square foot, implicitly), millimeters, mils... why
choose between the imperial and metric system when you could make an
even more convoluted global standard setup that drags in units from
both?)</p>

<p>Section 3: device power components (Total: $8.31, from various
suppliers around ebay as of 2017-01-18)</p>
<p>These device power supply components are standard blocks that have
been cloned by multiple suppliers. They're cheap, common, identical
from multiple manufacturers and sellers, and they appear reliable
(never had one break yet), but I can't find the "proper"
names and model numbers for them. So I've linked ebay search results
instead of specific product pages.</p>

<p><strong>WHENEVER I SAY GLUE I MEAN HOT-MELT GLUE!</strong></p>
<p>I am using hot-melt glue to hold this entire device together.
Hot-melt glue is nonconductive, gap filling, and possible to remove
for rework with a heat gun. All of the modules in this device have
different sizes of mounting holes, and gluing them down is much
easier than specifying 4 different sizes of screw and pilot hole.</p>
<p>[ -- Used in step -- ]</p>
<p>Hot-melt glue</p>
<p>Solder</p>
<p>Stranded wire pair, 24ga</p>
<p>Solid wire, 22ga</p>
<p>1x DPDT switch</p>
<p>2x 4AA battery holder</p>
<p>2x boost regulator</p>
<p>2x digital panel meter</p>
<p>1x (203mm x 132mm x 5mm) medium-density fiberboard (MDF)</p>
<p>1x (203mm x 20mm x 20mm) square dowel</p>
<p>2x (90mm x 20mm x 20mm) square dowel</p>
<p>2x (85mm x 20mm x 20mm) square dowel, required_length is given by
the equation:</p>
<p>required_length = (203mm - your switch length in mm) / 2</p>
<p>[ -- Procedure -- ]</p>
<p>Glue the five pieces of dowel and the switch to the medium-density
fiberboard (MDF) as shown. Roughen the backs of the battery holders
and the corresponding location on the MDF with sandpaper, then wipe
the rough spots clean with dry paper towel or cloth. These mating
surfaces require roughening because the glue joint will be subjected
to extra stess when batteries are inserted or removed. Use hot-melt
glue to adhere the battery holders to the MDF as shown.</p>
<p>Align the device with the battery holders directly facing you and
the switch pointed up, and drill a 5mm hole in the middle of the
space above the battery holder on the left. This hole does not need
to be precisely located. Draw a border line on the MDF, on the side
opposite the battery holders, 20mm in from the edge of the board.
Keep parts, wires, and glue inside this border line.</p>
<p>Run wires from the battery packs to the switch, as shown in the
schematic, and then through the hole to the top of the board. Solder
all joints. Glue wires in place, sealing the hole.</p>
<p>Set the device down with the switch and battery holders facing
down. Glue the panel meters to the top of the device, as shown. Twist
(but don't solder, yet) the leads from each panel meter to the plus
and minus of the correct wire pair, that is, the one from the battery
holder directly below it.</p>
<p>[ --- TEST STEP --- ]</p>
<p>Put batteries in one of the holders. Turn on the switch and verify
that the panel meter above this holder illuminates. Turn off the
switch and verify that the panel meter turns off. Move the batteries
to the other holder and repeat this process for the other meter.</p>
<p>If the test above is passed, remove all batteries and solder the
twisted wires. Glue the boost converters to the MDF, as shown. Melt
extra solder onto the IN+ and IN- pads of each boost converter. For
each boost converter input terminal, liquify this extra solder and
melt the soldered twisted pair from the battery holder / panel meter
into it. It does not matter which boost converter each battery holder
connects to, as long as both the + and - from each battery holder go
to the same converter.</p>
<p>[ --- TUNE STEP --- ]</p>
<p>Put batteries in both holders. Turn the device on. Measure the
output voltage of one of the boost converters with a multimeter, and
adjust the potentiometer (with a tiny screwdriver) until the output
voltage is 36V. Repeat this process with the other boost converter.</p>
<p>Solder the boost converters together in series and run wire to
where the board will be placed, as shown in the picture.</p>

<p>Soldering the Board</p>
<p>================================</p>

<p> </p>
<p>This board might look intimidating if you haven't done much SMD
soldering work, but it's not actually that hard*, so don't worry!
<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1Q2XTPf2Q8xRjNiU3hGeVhER0E/view?pli=1">Here's
a guide to SMD soldering, also attached at the bottom of this step.</a></p>
<p>*As long as your iron is temperature controlled, you get pretty
much infinite do-overs. You *will* bridge the pins, unless you're
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUyetZ5RtPs">this person</a>,
and that's OK! Simply remove the solder bridges with a desoldering
braid afterwards.</p>
<p>All LEDs are aligned cathode down, and all chips with 6 or more
pins are aligned with pin 1 in the top left, in the view shown above.
Everything else's alignment is either obvious (3 pins and only fits
one way) or doesn't matter (resistors and nonpolarized ceramic
capacitors). I designed this board with ease of building in mind.</p>
<p>[ -- Used in step -- ]</p>
<p>Temperature controlled soldering iron (recommendation for Sn/Pb
solder: set to 320 C for soldering, 375 C for desoldering with the
desoldering braid)</p>
<p>Flux pen</p>
<p>Desoldering braid</p>
<p>Tweezers</p>
<p>60/40 or 63/37 Sn/Pb solder, fine diameter, rosin core</p>
<p>Circuit boards and tiny components previously ordered from Mouser
and Seeed</p>
<p>[ -- Procedure -- ]</p>
<p>Your soldering process for multipin surface mount chips will look
like this:</p>
<p>1. Use flux pen to coat pads on board</p>
<p>2. Blob solder on a corner pad</p>
<p>3. Grab chip with tweezers and align on circuit board pads while
holding iron tip to the corner pad that got extra solder</p>
<p>4. Remove soldering iron tip, check chip/pad alignment, GOTO 3 if
chip is misaligned</p>
<p>5. Melt solder into the general vicinity of the pins/pads. Some
pins will probably be bridged.</p>
<p>6. Raise iron temperature, remove solder bridges with desoldering
braid</p>
<p>7. Reexamine solder joints for bridging, GOTO 5 if bridged (adding
a little solder to a bridge so it's convex makes it easier to remove
with the desoldering braid)</p>

<p>Solder ISO/+36V, ISO/GND, and ISO/-36V lines from the boost

SPI_VCC, SPI_GND, SPI_*CS, SPI_SCK, and SPI_MOSI lines from the
Arduino to the corresponding pads on the tES device board. Solder the
1kOhm resistor across HUMAN_+I_OUT and HUMAN_GND as shown. This
resistor is used for testing the device. It's very important to test
the device before connecting it to anyone's head. I shouldn't have to
tell you that, but I'll say it again louder just to make sure:</p>
<p><strong>IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TEST THE DEVICE BEFORE CONNECTING

<p>PRESERVE OUTPUT ELECTRICAL ISOLATION! DO NOT CONNECT SPI_GND TO

<p>[ -- Test steps -- ]</p>
<p>With the device off, measure the resistance between the

the bottom right (see red arrow in the above picture). This
resistance should be between 4.18kOhm and 4.62kOhm.</p>
<p>Turn the device power switch on. The green LED on the tES device
board should illuminate. Measure the voltage between HUMAN_+I_OUT and
HUMAN_GND (across the 1kOhm test resistor). This voltage should have
a magnitude of less than 10mV (it measures -0.5mV on my device).</p>
<p>Turn the device off again. Just to make sure, measure the
resistance (again) between the HUMAN_+I_OUT pad<br/>
and the top
solder joint of the 2.2kOhm resistor on the bottom right (see red
arrow in the above picture). This resistance should be between
4.18kOhm and 4.62kOhm. This test is repeated because those resistors
are a critical safety system.</p>

<p>Plug the Arduino Nano into a USB port and start the Arduino
development environment.Go to Tools > Port, and see which port the
Arduino is connected to. This port will vary depending on which OS
your computer has, and which specific USB port on your computer the
Arduino is connected to. The other settings in the Tools menu should
be: Board type: Arduino Nano, Processor type: ATmega328, Progammer:
AVRISP mkII.</p>
<p>In the Arduino IDE, load FINAL_BUFFER_DAC7311, which is <a href="https://github.com/quicksilv3rflash/Precision_tES_tACS_tRNS_tDCS/tree/master/arduino_nano_firmware/FINAL_BUFFER_DAC7311">linked
on github here</a>, and also embedded at the bottom of this step.
Press Ctrl+R, wait for the Arduino IDE to report "the sketch
uses X% of the program memory space" and then press Ctrl+U. Wait
for the green "loading bar" to finish its progress. In the
Arduino IDE, open the serial monitor (Tools > serial monitor).
When set to 115200 baud and the correct serial port location, the
serial monitor should show "ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ" ('y's with umlauts, in my system) forever. The
program on the Arduino is sending 0xFF over and over, because its
buffer is empty and it's requesting data to fill it. The hex code
0xFF might render as something different on your system, on mine it's
a lowercase letter y with an umlaut. At this point the firmware is
loaded and good to go!</p>
<p>Open IDLE. IDLE will have been installed with Python as your
default Python IDE. Within IDLE, type "import pygame" and
press enter. If you see "ImportError", you need to figure
out if you've got incompatible version numbers of Python and PyGame,
and go through the install process for each one again, but more
carefully. Google and StackExchange can help you do this. If you
DON'T see "ImportError", you're golden. Type
"help(pygame)", press enter, and verify that a huge wall of
text (that you don't need to read) appears. Next, type "import
serial", press enter, verify there isn't an ImportError, type
"help(serial)", press enter, and verify that another wall
of text appears. If "import serial" fails, you need to look
at your PySerial installation and verify you have compatible version
numbers and that you properly followed the installation instructions.
Close IDLE.</p>
<p>Run the python script KludgeGUI. A console window will appear,
asking you for the serial port location. On my setup, this location
(shown in the Arduino IDE under menu Tools > Port) is called COM6,
so I type in COM6 and press enter. A second window will appear over
the console window, a graphical interface, named "tES device
control program". This is the GUI to control the device.
Everything [IN BRACKETS] in the GUI is a clickable button that
changes the output. The output waveform is shown in the GUI. If you
increase the frequency, the waveform image in the GUI will become
more like a set of stairs than a smooth curve. This is not an error
in the GUI, the distortions shown in the GUI match the output
waveform (as seen with an oscilloscope) very closely.</p>
<p>[ -- Test step -- ]</p>
<p>After connecting the device, with the device power switch on, open
KludgeGUI and verify that the device's amber LED turns on, and the RX
and TX LEDs on the Arduino become active. Measure the output voltage
across the test resistor. The voltage across the 1kOhm test resistor
should measure &lt; 10 mV in magnitude, on my system the measured
value is -0.8mV.</p>
<p> </p><p> </p>
<p>================================</p>
<p>Testing and Verification</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="tacs_assembly_ix.jpg"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Turn the device on, but do not connect it to the computer yet.
Verify that the green LED on the tES device board turns on but the
amber one does not (the amber LED might briefly flash during device
turn-on, which is ok). Measure the output voltage across the 1kOhm
test resistor, it should be less than 10mV in magnitude (-0.5mV on my
device).</p>
<p>Plug the tES device into your computer and use the Arduino IDE to
find out which serial (called COMsomething on windows,
/dev/tty.something on mac) port it is connected to. Launch KludgeGUI
and enter the appropriate serial port. The RX and TX LEDs on the
Arduino should become active, and the amber LED on the tES device
circuit board should illuminate. Measure the output voltage across
the 1kOhm test resistor again, it should be less than 10mV in
magnitude (-0.8mV on my device).</p>
<p>Perform final tuning on the boost converters. With the device
connected and on, and KludgeGUI running, and after verifying that the
device's amber LED is on, measure the output voltage of each boost
converter and turn the set-screw on each boost converter until their
output voltages measure 36.0V. You may use hot-glue to fix the
position of the tuning potentiometers on the boost converters after
doing this, if you wish.</p>
<p>Bring up KludgeGUI. Set the mode to DC by clicking on [DIRECT
CURRENT], then click [RUN STIMULATOR]. Measure the DC voltage across
the 1kOhm test resistor as you change the DC BIAS by clicking on the
buttons in the DC BIAS box in the bottom right of the GUI. The
voltage you measure across the 1kOhm resistor should be equal to the
output current (DC BIAS) in mA, with an error equal to the accuracy
of your meter plus the tolerance of your resistor, +/-5% if you used
a standard resistor like I did. Test by setting the GUI to output a
current of -2mA, -1mA, +0mA, +1mA, and +2mA. Verify that output
voltage across 1kOhm test resistor (approximately) equals -2V, -1V,
+0V, +1V, and +2V for each test case. For my own test setup, these
results are -1.97V, -0.98V, -0.00V, +0.98V, and +1.97V. My "1kOhm"
resistor is actually 991 Ohms according to my multimeter.</p>
<p>Disconnect and power off the device, tie a knot in the Arduino's
USB cable as shown, and solder the USB connector to the Arduino. Only
solder along the metal edges of the connector and socket. This is not
the most elegant termination in the world, but it's the
easiest/simplest/most reliable one I could cheaply access for this
device. Desolder the 1kOhm test resistor and solder the TENS leads
(leads with 2mm pins) to the output terminals, with the RED pin
connecting to HUMAN_+I_OUT and the BLACK pin connecting to HUMAN_GND.
Don't try to twist the wire in your output leads after stripping it,
just tin it with solder. Most TENS leads use fancy polymer/wire
hybrid stuff that doesn't twist neatly like stranded wire.</p>
<p>Reconnect the device, turn it on, and load KludgeGUI. Set your
multimeter to measure mA and connect it to the output pins of the
device. Set the GUI to [DIRECT CURRENT], [RUN STIMULATOR], and adjust
DC BIAS (lower right of GUI window) while you measure the output
current of the device. With my setup, -2mA, -1mA, 0mA, +1mA, and +2mA
GUI settings result in the meter readings -1.99mA, -0.99mA, -0.00mA,
+0.99mA, and +1.99mA. Your measurements should be within about 5% of
the set current, with 1% allowed for the actual device's output
current tolerance and 4% added for whatever your meter's tolerance
is.</p>

<p>Tie a knot in the TENS (red/black 2mm pin) output leads; position
the knot so it falls just within the corner of the black guideline.
In case you're wondering, the knots in the output and input leads are
to function as strain relief, and will be glued to the case border.
That way, if the cable gets yanked on, the stress is stopped at the
knot and case border, and the soldered part isn't put under tension.</p>
<p>Glue the square dowels to the tES device. Glob extra hot glue
around the knots, and make sure to fill all gaps between the dowels.
We're sealing the upper compartment so that the device will continue
to limit the current through the human even if someone spills soda on
it while it's turned on. Peel the protective layers off the
polycarbonate sheet. With the voltage indicators facing up, run a
bead of hot glue all around the top of the square dowels and then
(quickly, before it cools) press the polycarbonate sheet down onto
it. The top compartment of the device should now be sealed, but the
indicator lights, wiring, et cetera will be visible.</p>
<p>Duct tape the rectangle of MDF to the bottom of the device, under

<p>If you have read and followed the steps up to this point, you will

on, I will explain the deeper theory of how the device was designed,
and how it operates. This information is useful to customize the

<p>================================</p>
<p>Two Current Sources, a Load, and Some
Guy Named Kirchhoff</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="tacs_theory_iii.jpg"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Consider two current sources with a load resistor connected as
shown. By Kirchhoff's Current Law, the sum of the currents into a
node must equal the sum of the currents out of the node. So I_top =
I_bottom + I_load, which we can rearrange algebraically to be I_load
= I_top - I_bottom. In the first schematic shown, we are given values
for I_top (2.5mA) and I_bottom(2mA), so we find I_load to be 0.5mA.</p>
<p>If we make the bottom current source variable based on a control
voltage, Vctl, such that I_bottom = (Vctl / 1.0866) mA, we can
smoothly vary I_load between +2.5mA and -2.1mA by varying Vctl
between 0V and 5V. This circuit allows you to control the current
through the load based on a control voltage, Vctl, with a fixed
current source and a voltage-controlled current sink. After we add
extra circuitry to cut that output current range down to +/- 2.1mA,
the load will be some saline-soaked sponges and a human head! (about
4.7kOhm)</p>
<p> </p><p> </p>
<p>================================</p>
<p>Practical Current Sources and Sinks</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="tacs_theory_iv.jpg"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Precise current sources and sinks may be built using op-amps and
transistors as shown. While BJTs, bipolar junction transistors, are
shown in this schematic, appropriately N- or P-channel MOSFETs will
work as well*. The load current I_load will be roughly equal to V_ref
/ R_sense. Error comes from -- among other places -- the base current
in the transistor; this error is usually &lt;1% for a typical
small-signal transistor. In the design of this transcranial
electrical stimulator, darlington pair transistors are used instead
of normal BJTs to decrease the error caused by transistor base
current significantly, to less than 0.005%.</p>
<p>These current supplies will have a voltage drop of
(transistor_V_b_e + V_ref).</p>
<p>*In the circuits shown here, MOSFETs may cause more trouble with
spurious oscillations than BJTs.</p>
<p> </p><p> </p>
<p>================================</p>
<p>Failures, Safety Resistors, and Supply
Rails</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="tacs_theory_v.jpg"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let's reconsider one of our design specifications. The human head
and electrodes have a resistance of 4.7kOhm, so we will design for a
worst-case resistance of 9.4kOhm.</p>
<p>We need a bipolar supply for our current sources. This supply must
have enough voltage for the current sources/sinks to be able to
provide 2.1mA through our human.</p>
<p>The available voltage we need is: V_across_human +
V_current_source_drop</p>
<p>Using ohm's law, V=IR,</p>
<p>V_across_human = I_through_human * R_of_human</p>
<p>V_across_human = 2.1mA * 9.4kOhm = 19.74V</p>
<p>Now we need V_current_source_drop.</p>
<p>V_current_source_drop is V_ref_max + V_transistor_base_emitter</p>
<p>5V + 1.4V = 6.4V (our actual V_transistor_base_emitter will be a
little lower, but we're designing for the worst-case value)</p>
<p>So the total required voltage is 26.14V.</p>
<p>However, we need to add some safety protection. In the image
above, you see two extra resistors, each 2.2kOhm. These are for
safety. The reason there are two resistors in series is so that even
if one somehow fails short-circuit, there will still be a limiting
resistor present. I've never seen a short-circuit failure happen with
these resistors, but I <em>have</em> seen one (of the part number I
specified, 35202K2JT, out of about two hundred 35202K2JTs tested by
me personally) fail open-circuit, but that's ok, it's a graceful
failure, since the device output current becomes zero (which is
safe).</p>
<p>These 2.2kOhm safety resistors do nothing, usually. Actually, they
<em>worsen</em> the performance of the circuit by burning off exta
voltage. Since V=IR, V_safety_resistor = I_max * R_safety, V = 2.1mA
* 4.4kOhm,</p>
<p>V_safety_resistor_loss = 9.24V</p>
<p>The total required voltage thus becomes 26.14V + 9.24V = 35.34V,
so we're going to use +/- 36V supplies.</p>
<p>Now let's examine what happens if one of the current supplies
fails short circuit. This is equivalent to connecting the input of
the safety resistors directly to plus or minus 36V. Regardless of
polarity, the current magnitude that flows will be given by 36V /
(R_human + R_safety), 36V / (4.7kOhm + 4.4kOhm) = 3.96mA. This is
outside of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2754807/">recommended
+/- 2.1mA current limit for human heads</a>, but it shouldn't be
enough to cause any permanent damage or memory loss. (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2933093/">ECT,
electroconvulsive therapy, uses about 800mA</a>, and DOES cause
memory loss; if short-circuit failure of a primary current limiter
occurs, this device's safety resistors limit its output current to
0.5% of the current used for ECT)</p>
<p>In the event of a perfect power supply short directly through one
of the series pass transistors, a simultaneous open-circuit failure
of the other series pass transistor, and a spherical, ideally
conducting human attached to the output, the safety resistors will
limit the output current to +/-8.2mA.</p>
<p>This device is also designed so you can get it up and running with
fewer parts than shown in the instructions. The quick-and-dirty way
to power the device is to make a series chain of eight 9V batteries,
attach the ends of the chain to plus and minus 36V (isolated), and
then tap the middle of the battery chain (battery battery?) for
ISO/GND. Note that more current is drawn from the negative supply
than the positive one, so a chain of batteries like this won't drain
evenly, the bottom four will drain faster.</p>
<p> </p><p> </p>
<p>================================</p>
<p>Making It Real</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="tacs_theory_vi.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="tacs_theory_vii.jpg"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now we're going to turn the theoretical pieces we've examined so
far into a design with real-world parts. This is the design of the
device's output stage, which takes a bipolar power supply (+36V / +0V
/ -36V) and a control voltage (Vctl, between 0V and 5V referenced to
the -36V supply rail), and uses them to produce a precise
voltage-controlled current between +2.5mA and -2.1mA (we'll cut that
range down to +/- 2.1mA later). The op-amps are dual because an
additional op-amp is required to cut the output current range, and I
attempted to keep the parts count down. Only a single op-amp is used
on the +36V rail's current source, but specifying a single op-amp
there would increase the number of unique parts in the design, for
minimal cost savings, which needlessly makes inventory, ordering, and
populating the board more difficult.</p>
<p>The op-amp power supplies are 8.6V, about, op-amp power supply
voltage is not critical as long as:</p>
<p>1) op amp max supply voltage,16V for our TLC2252s, is not exceeded
</p>
<p>2) there's enough voltage to drive the current sink. For us, 6.4V;
5V maximum dropped across the resistors R3 and R4 + 1.4V worst-case
V_b_e of the darlington pair transistor + op-amp headroom (0V for us,
TLC2252s are rail-to-rail ^.^ )</p>
<p>Op-amp power supplies are taken from simple <a href="http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/power-management/linear-power-supply-psu/series-voltage-regulator-theory-circuit.php">emitter
follower voltage regulators</a>, AKA <a href="http://www.circuitstoday.com/voltage-regulators">transistor
series voltage regulators</a>; the voltage regulators get their
voltage reference from modern integrated shunt voltage references --
these integrated references are electrically equivalent to zener
diodes but perform orders of magnitude better in terms of precision
and V/I curve knee sharpness. Vref is also taken from a (precision)
integrated shunt voltage reference. As <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/4003">Maxim
says, "[a shunt reference] is similar in concept to a zener
diode, but has much better specifications.</a>"</p>
<p>There are lots of factors to consider in the real world, and I
have calculated them, but I'm going to leave it to the reader to
pursue the part-by-part level of analysis, should they wish to. Each
component has its own power dissipation rating and worst-case power
dissipation in this circuit, and it's necessary to check all of them
to make sure the design is safe. I checked this design for safe
levels of power dissipation twice: first, I drew the entire device
schematic on giant 100cm x 50cm quadrille paper, annotated the
schematic with worst-case currents through each branch, calculated
the power dissipation for each part, and verified that power
dissipation was safely within each component's rated limits. After
double-checking my theoretical calculations and the component
datasheets to ensure calculated design power was within each part's
rated limits, I built the prototype and left it fully on for about an
hour, and poked each part with a finger. No part was unpleasantly
hot. (Semiconductors are actually OK to run unpleasantly hot, die
temperature is allowed to go up to 100 C for most devices, but if you
can touch everything on your device without discomfort after running
it for a long time then the semiconductors will be within a healthy
30 C safety margin. <strong>READERS WILL REMEMBER NOT TO USE THIS
TECHNIQUE ON HIGH-VOLTAGE DEVICES</strong>)</p>
<p>V_CTL comes from a DAC7311IDCKR. We'll talk about our DAC7311 in
more detail once we're in the software section. For now, all you need
to know is that it has an output that goes between 0V and 5V,
requires precisely regulated +5V / +0V power supply rails, and the
DAC7311 takes three input lines, named *CS, SCK, and MOSI</p>
<p>(or *SYNC, SCLK, and D_IN, respectively, depending on who you
ask...)</p>
<p> </p><p> </p>
<p>================================</p>
<p>Clipping That Current Range</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="tacs_theory_viii.jpg"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our DAC7311 is "well behaved". It will always turn on
with 0V output. However, for the design we've been considering up
until now, that 0V DAC output (DAC output is Vctl) would lead to
+2.5mA output current, which is a bit high, and also a really lousy
default. Really, we want our device to output 0mA when it powers on
with no data signal applied.</p>
<p>Easy. We turn off the entire +36V rail (and thus the fixed 2.5mA
positive current source) when the DAC output, AKA V_CTL, is less than
0.435V. That way, the device will power on with 0mA output, gradually
lower to -0.4mA output as the DAC output, Vctl, rises, and then at a
critical point, 0.435V DAC output, the +2.5mA fixed supply will turn
on, bringing the output up to +2.1mA. From 0.435V up to +5V Vctl (DAC
output voltage), the output current will linearly decline to -2.1mA.
This comparator-derived rail-switching command signal is passed from
the (weak, low-voltage) op-amp through (hardy, high-voltage)
<a href="http://www.play-hookey.com/digital_experiments/rtl/rtl_inverter.html">resistor-transistor
logic inverters</a> to switch the +36V rail.</p>
<p>In the device, when the positive rail is turned on, the amber
indicator LED lights.</p>
<p>Here's how this solution is inelegant, and why that doesn't
matter:</p>
<p>Turning off -- and on -- the *entire* +36V rail is not a gentle
thing to do with the circuitry. The positive regulator's op-amp
experiences a turn-on transient each time the rail is switched, and
there is ringing around this change in state, too. Furthermore, the
use of an internally compensated op-amp as a comparator is a poor
choice; internally compensated op-amps are slow comparators because
of their built-in low-pass filters, and garden variety op-amps are
designed to be operated closed-loop, usually (as opposed to
comparators, which are open-loop); normal op-amps will be much slower
to recover from open-loop saturation (being flung to the ends of
their output voltage range) than comparators are.</p>
<p>However. As this device is designed, in normal operation, the
positive rail is always on. This rail-switching circuitry is only
active when the device is first turned on, before any data is
supplied to it. The first thing the control program does is to fill
the data buffer with values that cause the current source and sink to
be exactly balanced, which sets the device to output 0mA but puts it
in the middle of its active range. From that point forward, the +36V
rail remains on, so its inelegant transient behavior can be safely
ignored.</p>

<p>Isolation Is Safer Than Connection</p>

<p>Adding isolation is pretty easy. We use a part called a digital
isolator, specifically the SI8630BD-B-IS. This nifty thing passes
three digital channels (for us, the 3-wire SPI bus, *CS, SCK, and
MOSI) without an electrical connection. The left side gets one supply
and ground (2.5V - 5V), and the right side gets another (2.5V - 5V).
As a side effect, we can connect this board to any SPI source (up to
50MHz) with any logic voltage between 2.5V and 5V, no level shifter
or extra parts required!</p>
<p>The circuitry connected to your head needs to be electrically
isolated from the AC line. There are lots of good reasons for this,
but let me outline a worst-case scenario that should make the
necessity for electrical isolation clear:</p>
<p>Assume you use this device with an AC line connected computer.
Let's say the people who wired your computer's outlet somehow
accidentally connected the earth pin to the hot conductor of the AC
line. If the USB ground of the tES device were directly connected to
the HUMAN_GND terminal, and while using the device you touched a
metal sink or other earth-grounded object, current would then flow
through your body between the HUMAN_GND electrode and the earth
ground you were touching. This would be highly unpleasant and/or
lethal. Electrically isolating the device's output prevents this risk
and several others.</p>
<p>Medical devices are required to follow stringent safety standards.
According to IEC60601-1, clause 2.1.5, this device has "Type BF"
applied parts (the bits connected to you), type BF being
"Electrically connected to Patient but not directly to heart".
However... to actually *read* IEC6061-1 <a href="https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/2606">the
International Electrotechnical Commission wants me to pay $350 for
the privelege of even looking at their standards</a>! Technically 350
Swiss Francs, not US dollars, yes, but as of 2017-03-22, 350CHF =
$352.43 US, which is close enough. And that price is only for "Part
1" ... medical things, (drugs, hardware, <em>even just looking
at the regulations</em>) appear to be specifically designed to drain
your finances.</p>
<p>Luckily, the manufacturer of the isolator I'm using (part number
SI8630BD-B-IS) has a freely available whitepaper that <a href="https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/white-papers/CMOS-Advanced-Galvanic-Isolators-for-Medical-Electronics.pdf">states
that the isolator family I've chosen for this device is acceptable
for use with AC-line-powered medical devices</a>, so it <em>should</em>
be acceptable for this isolation application too, as the isolator
will be exposed to lower voltages. Unless your house wiring is
screwed up, in which case the isolator is specified to be capable of
handling that too.</p>

<p>The DAC expects 16 bit SPI writes, SPI mode 1, CPOL=0, CPHA=1, MSB
first.</p>
<p>To use the tES device within its recommended operating parameters,
restrict the values written to the DAC:</p>
<p>0x06CF < (data written to DAC) < 0x3EC1</p>
<p>As long as the DAC write values are bounded as described above,
the device's output will follow the equation: 
</p>
<p>(OUTPUT_CURRENT)mA = 2.5mA - (0.00028*DAC_WRITE_VALUE)mA 
</p>
<p>The equation returns results in mA! So to control the DAC easily
from within python code: 
</p>
<p>dacwrite =
(int(round(((16383*1.0866)/5)*(2.5-value_in_mA)))).to_bytes(2,byteorder="big",signed=False)</p>
<p>If you have an Arduino/other SPI source of any type up to 50MHz,
and any operating voltage between 2.5V and 5.5V (level conversion is
automatically performed by the SI8630) on hand you can simply connect
its SPI signal (except MISO, the DAC doesn't send any data back) and
+VDD/GND pins to the device at the row of 5 pins behind electrical
isolation (SPI_VCC, SPI_*CS, SPI_GND, SPI_SCK, SPI_MOSI).</p>
<p>More detail about the DAC itself can be found in the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/dac7311.pdf">DAC7311
datasheet</a>.</p>

<p>Using an Arduino As a Data Buffer</p>
<p>================================</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/quicksilv3rflash/Precision_tES_tACS_tRNS_tDCS/blob/master/arduino_nano_firmware/FINAL_BUFFER_DAC7311/FINAL_BUFFER_DAC7311.ino">The
Arduino firmware</a> is thoroughly commented and pretty
straightforward. The firmware is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer">simple
ring buffer</a>, which holds 256 two-byte values, pushes them out to
the DAC every 512 microseconds, and screams "0xFF" over the
serial port when it has room for another 128 two-byte values. The
only real surprise in the firmware is that the timer interrupt
settings for the 512 microsecond delay are really specific, and the
device does not perform as would normally be expected if these values
are changed, due to hidden interrupt access and modification by the
explicitly declared spi.h, and the serial.h built into the Arduino
IDE itself.</p>
<p>Changing the timer interrupt settings in the firmware is not
recommended unless you have an oscilloscope, and don't mind wading
into <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42735-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega328-328P_Datasheet.pdf">the
442 page ATmega328 datasheet</a> to cross-reference the TIMSK values
(page 211 for TIMSK2, which controls the counter driving the data
output timing in the firmware) with the source code of SPI.h and the
Arduino software itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/quicksilv3rflash/Precision_tES_tACS_tRNS_tDCS/blob/master/KludgeGUI.py">KludgeGUI</a>
turned out to be generally user-friendly and relatively bug-free, but
if you want features besides those already programmed into it, I
recomend that you don't try to extend it, and use <a href="https://github.com/quicksilv3rflash/Precision_tES_tACS_tRNS_tDCS/blob/master/DAC_format_function">this
linked python function</a> (also embedded at the bottom of this step)
as your starting point, instead.</p>
<p>There's a <em>reason</em> it's called KludgeGUI, after all.
Spaghetti code, lots of global variables, minimal commenting,
inelegant repetitive code blocks, incomprehensible variable names...
"certified operational at 4:55 AM".</p>
<p>However, KludgeGUI does control and display the waveform
accurately, even when the output waveform experiences sampling
distortion, as seen above.</p>
